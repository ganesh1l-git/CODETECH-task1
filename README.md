   OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT

   Project Description

The Basic Calculator is an interactive command-line program designed to perform fundamental arithmetic operations. It prompts users to input two numerical values and select a desired operation, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division. The program then calculates and displays the result. The calculator is designed for continuous use, allowing users to perform multiple operations until they choose to exit.

Key Features

1. Arithmetic Operations:

Addition
Subtraction
Multiplication
Division (with error handling for division by zero)

2. Interactive User Interface:
Easy-to-follow prompts for inputs and operation selection.
Clear display of results for better readability.

3. Error Handling:
Handles non-numeric inputs gracefully.
Prevents division by zero with appropriate error messages.

4. Continuous Use:
Users can perform multiple calculations in one session.
Option to exit the program when desired.


Technical Details
Programming Language: Python
Modules Used: None (entirely built with Pythonâ€™s core features)
Input/Output Handling:
User input is gathered via the input() function.
Output is displayed with formatted strings for clarity.

Control Flow: Implements loops (while) and conditional statements (if-elif-else) for functionality.

User Workflow

1. Start the Program: The user runs the script, and the calculator greets them.
2. Input Numbers: The user enters two numerical values.
3. Choose Operation: The user selects an operation from the menu.
4. Get Result: The calculator computes and displays the result.
5. Repeat or Exit: The user can perform another calculation or exit the program.

Potential Use Cases

Quick, on-the-go calculations.
Teaching basic programming concepts such as loops, conditionals, and input validation
A foundation for building more advanced calculators (e.g., scientific or financial).

Future Enhancements

1. Additional Operations:
Exponents, square roots, or modulo calculations.

2. Input History: Keep a log of all operations performed in a session.

3. GUI Integration: Create a graphical interface for a more user-friendly experience.

4. Advanced Error Handling: Include more robust validation for edge cases.

This project is an excellent example of how Python can be used to create simple, user-friendly tools while providing a solid foundation for more advanced programming projects.
